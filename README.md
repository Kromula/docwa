# DOC Weak Aurea Packs

I have created this repository to better store and update my WA packs. The main advantage here is I can use a bot to automatically push update notifications to my Discord. I will still push all updates to wago.io


## **Installation**
To install, simply copy the string from the class folder you want and import via WeakAuras ingame.

## **Features**
- Nested group containing dynamic groups.
- Contains stack counters and timers where appropriate.
- Glow effects to draw attention to primary buffs.
- Optimised pack for performance and avoid FPS impacts.

  

### **Who are you?**
I am a Mythic raider playing the game since Vanilla Friends and Family alpha invites. Mythic raiding is my primary focus. 

### **Why did you make your own WA packs?**
I have always had an interest in creating and maintaing various elements of the user interface for a long period of time. A number of various UI profiles and WA profiles of mine have become popular over the years. 
I was also dismayed at how inefficient and sub-optimal popular WA packs had become causing significant performance issues ingame, so went back to using my own styles and layouts that I know are optimised for Mythic raiding.
