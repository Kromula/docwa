![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c8f8db7b-836c-443b-83fc-307d12b2cb69)


This pack contains WA layout for Druid classes that I play

- Nested group containing dynamic groups
- Contains stack counters and timers where appropriate
- Glow effects to draw attention to primary buffs
- Optimized pack for performance and avoid FPS impacts

*Note that I do not play Feral and Resto that much, so the packs for these specs may be slightly outdated
