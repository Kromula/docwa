#Druid WA Pack

This pack contains WA layout for Druid classes that I play

-Nested group containing dynamic groups
-Contains stack counters and timers where appropriate
-Glow effects to draw attention to primary buffs
-Optimized pack for performance and avoid FPS impacts

*Note that I do not play Feral and Resto that much, so the packs for these specs may be slightly outdated
