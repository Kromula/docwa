![image](https://media.wago.io/screenshots/gyhnVF_b_/66031eb9ebdcef75d57de1c0.png)


This pack contains WA layout for Warlock specs that I play

- Nested group containing dynamic groups
- Contains stack counters and timers where appropriate
- Glow effects to draw attention to primary buffs
- Optimized pack for performance and avoid FPS impacts

*Note that I mostly play Demo and Destro so affliction not configured
