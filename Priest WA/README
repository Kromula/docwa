This pack contains WA layout for Priest specs that I play

- Nested group containing dynamic groups
- Contains stack counters and timers where appropriate
- Glow effects to draw attention to primary buffs
- Optimized pack for performance and avoid FPS impacts

*Note that I do not Disc and Holy much so likely outdated
